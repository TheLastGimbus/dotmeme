## What is dotmeme?

Have you ever wanted to show your friend a meme, but it was buried deep down in you 3 thousand memes and 1 thousand screenshots collections?

dotmeme is exactly made for this! It allows you to **quickly** find memes on your phone!

### How does it work?

It continuously scans text on all memes from selected in background. Then, when you want to find something, you type in the text you remember, and it gives you everything that could be it :mag:


## Contributing

I try to keep this app as stable, tested, and documented as possible (even tho it's a side project) - so contributing should be very smooth for anyone! If you want to add fix some bugs that annoy you, add some features you would like to see, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more

### I just want to compile it myself...

This app has quite few dependencies, so you will need some set up. Don't worry, it's easy! Check out [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)
